# LightKeeper

## Introduction
**LightKeeper** is a **React Native** application designed to detect the environment's **light intensity** and automatically **control the flashlight** based on the detected levels. 

This app is a demonstration of my newly acquired skill of exposing native modules using React Native's **TurboModule** architecture. While simple in concept, it highlights the seamless integration of native functionality within a React Native project.

## Features
- Detect ambient light intensity using the device's light sensor.
- Automatically turn the flashlight on/off based on predefined thresholds.
- Built with React Native's TurboModules for native module integration.

## Supported Platforms
- **Android**
